# Cancel Discord Support Website

Quickly closes the Discord Support page after being opened through a misclick.

I often use the Inbox feature in Discord, but sometimes I accidentally misclick on the Help button,
which opens the Discord support website, which I don't need.  
This Firefox extension automatically closes that website again, and minimizes the browser window again, too,
so you'll barely notice that opened at all!

Tested on Firefox only.
Chrome users who want to use this addon should switch browsers.
